# Notes on teaching in Platoâ€™s dialogues

## *Phaedrus*

Socrates talks about the effect of writing on readers:

> For, since they have heard a lot without teaching, they think that they are very knowledgeable, but they are for the most part without knowledge, and they are difficult to be with since they have become people who think that they are wise instead of wise people (275a7-b2).

Socrates seems to believe that students cannot truly learn passively. How does this fit with his search for an expert or authority who knows? These positions need not contradict each other. In cases where we lack knowledge, we might be better off following the advice of an expert in the short term. At the same time, we could pursue knowledge through active learning even as we listen to experts until we are ready to guide ourselves.

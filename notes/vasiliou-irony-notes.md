# Notes on Iakovos Vasiliou’s account of Socratic irony

## Conditional Irony (*CQ*, vol. 49, no. 2, 1999, 456-472)

+ I don’t think that Vasiliou takes the “slippery slope” argument seriously on 457.
+ Vasiliou considers irony at a student “as an insult, albeit a lighter one than if [the teacher] said, ‘You are performing horribly today. We cannot continue’ (460). It is not clear to me that the irony *is* lighter. A lot would depend on further factors: how the people know each other, the details of the case, the tone of the teacher’s voice, etc. But *prima facie* I think a teacher who delivers a bad report via irony only adds mockery to bad news, and I don’t see how that is lighter. (This is not to say that someone could not be equally or more cruel without irony, just that irony by itself is not in any way a diminishment of the insult.)

# Rough notes on Plato's Meno

## The structure of Socrates' conversation with the slave

There are *two* discussions happening while Socrates talks to Meno's slave.

1. An outer discussion with Meno over whether or not inquiry is possible.
1. An inner discussion with the slave over the area of various squares.

The more important discussion is the first. Socrates uses the second in order to prove to Meno that learning is recollection. That proof matters because it allows Socrates to answer the lazy, eristic paradox that Meno poses to him earlier in the dialogue. After that, the conversation returns to its course.

The dialogue is subtitled περὶ ἀρετῆς in the ancient tradition. A more precise subtitle would have been περὶ τῆς τοῦ Σωκράτους μεθόδου, though I admit this is a lot less elegant. The unifying theme of the dialogue, however, is the Socratic method: its limits and Plato's innovations upon it. We find suggested answers to some of the questions about method, but the dialogue makes very little progress on questions about ἀρετή.

## The reconstruction of Meno's paradox

Fine and Scott argue that Meno's paradox relies on a claim that Meno and Socrates are "in a cognitive blank" about ἀρετή. I think this is wrong because (1) it's a bizarre and weak claim and (2) it doesn't fit the dialogue at all. However, I still owe them an alternate reconstruction of the paradox. Why is the paradox a genuine threat for Plato and not merely a sophistic puzzle?

# socratica

Eventually this may become something more directed. At the moment, it's simply
my notes on Socratic dialogues and issues in Socratic scholarship. Some notes
are more polished than others.

If you have a full install of LaTeX, you should be able to build pdfs from
this repo pretty easily. The Makefile provides targets for individual
dialogues or `make` (or `make all`) will build all the pdfs.

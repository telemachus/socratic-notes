# socratica

Eventually this may become something more directed. At the moment, it's simply my notes on several Socratic dialogues. Some notes are more polished than others. I focus primarily on the arguments in the dialogues, but I also talk about history and language sometimes.

If you have a full install of LaTeX, you should be able to build pdfs from
this repo pretty easily. The Makefile provides targets for individual
dialogues or `make` (or `make all`) will build all the pdfs.

However, if you don't have LaTeX installed or you just want to read the
pdfs and don't care about the LaTeX source, please see the [pdfs
branch][p].

# socratic-notes

Eventually this may become something more. At the moment, itâ€™s my notes on
Socratic dialogues and issues in Socratic scholarship. Some notes are more
polished than others.

If you have a full install of LaTeX, you should be able to build pdfs from
this repo relatively easily. The Makefile provides targets for individual
dialogues or `make` (or `make all`) will build all the pdfs.

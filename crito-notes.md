## Aristotle

In *Politics* VI, Aristotle considers the office that exacts punishments. He says that this office is “most necessary and also most difficult” (1321b40-41). The office is difficult since everyone hates this person, and thus nobody wants to do it. It is most necessary because “judicial decisions are useless if they take no effect; and if society cannot exist without them, neither can it exist without the execution of them” (1322a5-8).

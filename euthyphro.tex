\section{Characters and setting}

\subsection{Characters}

The dialogue is a conversation between two people, Socrates and Euthyphro.
They run into each other outside the office of the (so--called) king archon
(ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως στοά).  Both men are there because they have court cases
before the king archon.

Euthyphro appears to be the same person mentioned in \book{Charmides}
396a2--b1 and 396d2--e3.\footnote{\citet{burnet1924} 85 and
\citet{bailly2003} 16.}  He knows Socrates reasonably well, and he is very
surprised to see Socrates at court at all.  When Socrates explains that he's
being charged with corruption of the youth and religious crimes, Euthyphro
assumes that Socrates' \foreign{daimonion}\footnote{For a complete list of
references to the \foreign{daimonion}, see \citet{bailly2003} 32.}
is the reason.  Perhaps partly because of the \foreign{daimonion}, he sees
Socrates as a kindred spirit: Euthyphro views himself as a prophet and an
expert on religious matters.  Other Athenians, according to Euthyprho, view
both Socrates and Euthyprho as unusual because of their religious beliefs.
Other than the two Platonic dialogues, we have no other evidence about
Euthyphro.\footnote{\citet{bailly2003} 16.}

\subsection{Setting}

Because the king archon was responsible for various state religious
functions, he also oversaw certain trials~--- namely those that had to do
with religion.\footnote{\citet{burnet1924} 82--83.}  That's why both
Socrates and Euthyphro need to see him in particular.  It seems that
Euthyprho has already finished with the king archon since at the end of the
dialogue he runs off.\footnote{\citet{burnet1924} 82.}

You see the king archon twice before the trial. The first meeting is very
preliminary. The prosecutor gives the defendent a written version of the
charge and pays a fee.\footnote{\citet{brickhouse2004} 7--8.} The second
meeting with the king archon is the \foreign{anakrisis}. The
\foreign{anakrisis} is more elaborate. The defendent enters a formal plea,
and both sides answer questions about the case from the king archon.  At the
end of this meeting the king archon decides whether or not to send the case
forward to a formal trial.\footnote{See \citet{burnet1924} 82--83 and
\citet{brickhouse2004} 8.}

% {{{ On the trial and dialogue
\section{Background}

Here are some basic facts about the trial.  Socrates was brought to court
by Meletus, Anytus and Lycon.  The charges were impiety and corrupting the
youth.  In 399BCE, Socrates was convicted, sentenced to death and executed.
The trial was a \foreign{graphê} rather than a \foreign{dikê}.  In the case
of a \foreign{graphê}, anyone could prosecute, but only a victim or close
relative could prosecute a \foreign{dikê}.  In addition, the specific
charge that Socrates faced was a \foreign{agôn timêtos}.  This meant that
it didn't come with a specific penalty.  The prosecutor would demand
a penalty in the indictment, and if the defendant was convicted he or she
had an opportunity to specify a counter-penalty.  In this case, the
prosecution proposed the death penalty and Socrates proposed a penalty that
was no penalty at all.\footnote{See below for more on his proposed
penalty.}  As a religious crime, Socrates trial was held at the office of
the king-archon, whose jurisdiction included religious crimes.\footnote{For
all these legal matters and more historical background, see
\citet{brickhouse2004}, especially 72--79.}

Plato's \book{Apology} is only one of our sources for Socrates' trial, and
there are many questions about it.  We don't know exactly when Plato wrote
it, we don't know how accurate it is, we don't know how best to compare it
with the other surviving defense speech, Xenophon's \book{Apology}.  A very
common view is that (1) it is a very early Platonic work and (2) it
generally represents Socrates more accurately than Xenophon's speech does.
I worry that both assumptions rely too much on Plato's eloquence rather
than on firm (or even specific) arguments.  Nevertheless, it's the majority
view.  On the other hand, there's not much agreement as to how much of
Plato's \book{Apology} itself is Plato and how much is Socrates.\footnote{
\citet{brickhouse2004} 80--83 do a good job of showing how vague and
unhelpful this whole question is.}

\section{Proem (17a--18a6)}

Socrates starts by saying that the prosecutors spoke so powerfully that
even \emph{he} nearly forgot who Socrates was.  However, he continues, they
said nearly nothing true.   He also says that the most shameless lie of all
was that he was clever speaker, since his coming speech will immediately
disprove the prosecutors.\footnote{Of course, you could easily draw up
a long list of the rhetorical commonplaces in just this section of Socrates'
speech.  For example: eloquent but false versus plain but true; the simple
truth-speaker lost in the world of fancy speakers; truth needs no
adornments.}  This kicks off the tone and content of the rest of this
introduction.  Socrates promises to speak only the truth, but he begs
indulgence for his simple, unsophisticated speaking style.  He ends by
reminding the jurors that the ἀρετή of a juror is to judge whether someone
says just things or not, while the ἀρετή of a speaker is to speak the
truth.

% {{{ Socrates' two sets of accusers (18a7--19a7)
\section{Socrates' two sets of accusers (18a7--19a7)}

Socrates also explains that he has two sets of accusers and that he fears
the earlier accusers more than the current ones.  The current accusers are
the ones you would expect: Anytus, Meletus and Lycon.  The earlier accusers
are the ones who say that

\begin{quote}
    ἔστιν τις Σωκράτης σοφὸς ἀνήρ, τά τε μετέωρα φροντιστὴς καὶ τὰ ὑπὸ γῆς
    ἅπαντα ἀνεζητηκὼς καὶ τὸν ἥττω λόγον κρείττω ποιῶν (18b7--c1).

    There is some wise man Socrates, a thinker about heavenly matters and
    one who has investigated all things under earth and someone who makes
    the weaker argument stronger.
\end{quote}

These are more or less generic descriptions of sophistic activities.  The
only standard sophist accusation missing is that Socrates takes money to
teach other people to do these same things.

Socrates believes that they earlier accusers are dangerous to him for
a number of reasons.  First, people tend to believe that men like those
generic sophists don't believe in the gods.  This would obviously prejudice
jurors in his current case.  Second, there have been many such accusers and
they have been at it for a long time.  Third, they started in on the jurors
(and presumably on all the people of Athens) when they were young.  As
Socrates says, young people are especially credible.  Fourth, they've been
spreading these claims with nobody pleading the opposite case.\footnote{Both
Plato and Xenophon write partly for this reason.  Xenophon is more explicit,
but the desire to improve the reputation of Socrates is clear in Plato as
well.}  Fifth, Socrates does not know their names~--- except for
Aristophanes, who for some reason Socrates \emph{doesn't} name as
such.\footnote{He calls him ``a certain comic poet" at 17d1.  Is there some
point to this?}  Since he does not know their names, he cannot call them to
the stand and question them.

For all these reasons, Socrates asks for indulgence.  His jurors should be
patient as he defends himself first against his first accusers and then
against his current ones.  Socrates also expresses doubt that he will be
able to answer this long-standing slander in the short time given to him,
but he says simply, ``ὅμως τοῦτο μὲν ἴτω ὅπῃ τῷ θεῷ φίλον, τῷ δὲ νόμῳ
πειστέον καὶ ἀπολογητέον" (19a6--7).\footnote{"Nevertheless, let this go
however is pleasing to the god; I must obey the law and give my defence."
Note how Socrates manages to be both pious and obedient to the law of his
city here.}

\subsection{The first charges (19a8--20c3)}

Socrates begins by imagining what the first charges against him would have
been.

\begin{quote}

    τὸν ἥττω λόγον κρείττω ποιῶν καὶ ἄλλους ταὐτὰ ταῦτα διδάσκων

    and the heavens and making the weaker argument stronger and teaching
    others these same things.
\end{quote}

As evidence that something like this is the earlier charge against him,
Socrates refers to ``the comedy of Arisophanes" (19c3).  In response to
this multi-part charge, Socrates says that although he respects people who
have knowledge of these physical matters and who are able to teach others,
he has no such knowledge or ability.  He says that those who have heard him
talking will defend him on this score.

% {{{ The source of anti-Socratic feeling (20c4--24b2)
\subsection{The source of anti-Socratic feeling (20c4--24b2)}

Socrates acknowledges that this only pushes the problem back: if he
\emph{doesn't} do any of these things, then \emph{why} does he have this
reputation?  He explains this by telling the story of his divine mission.

% {{{ Socrates' divine mission (20e6--23c1)
\subsubsection{Socrates' divine mission (20e6--23c1)}

Once upon a time, Chaerephon asked the Delphic oracle if anyone was wiser
than Socrates and the oracle said that no one was wiser.  When Socrates
heard this, he was at a loss (ἠποροῦν, 20b7).  He knew that the god would
not lie, but he didn't think that he was wise at all.  In order to
understand better, Socrates set out to investigate and test the god's
words.  He went to someone believed to be wise, and his intention was to
show the god that this person was wiser than him.  However, Socrates
discovered that although that person \emph{thought} he was wise, he
actually was not.  Socrates showed this person that he wasn't actually
wise, and unsurprisingly this made the person angry at Socrates.  A number
of bystanders also grew angry at Socrates.  Socrates realized, however,
that although neither of them knew much of anything, Socrates at least knew
this while the other person thought he was wise. In this respect at least,
Socrates had to admit that he was wiser than the person he spoke with.

Socrates repeated this process systematically, first with politicians, then
poets and then craftspeople.  In each case, he had essentially the same
result.  Socrates was wiser in virtue of knowing that he wasn't wise.  And
in each case, people grew angry at Socrates.  Socrates attributes the ill
will against him to these investigations and others like them.  Socrates
also draws a lesson about what the god originally meant by his riddle:
Socrates is wisest insofar as he knows that he doesn't know much of
anything.  Socrates has continued to question people in service of the god.

It's worth saying that Socrates flirts with hubris at the start of this
story.  Although he acknowledges that the god wouldn't lie, he nevertheless
sets out to show the god someone wiser than himself.  Initially at least,
he seems to assume that he will find such a person.

Also note that Socrates experiences a kind of elenchus here at the hands of
the god that is not unlike what he dishes out to other people later. That
is, he is confused and frustrated; he is at a loss; he begins thinking that
he knows something,\footnote{Ironically enough, what he initially thinks he
knows is that he doesn't know anything.} but he eventually realizes that
he doesn't quite know what he thinks he does.  Unlike most Socratic
interlocutors, however, Socrates really learns from his experience.  He
doesn't dig in and become stuborn or refuse to face what he sees.

\subsection{Socrates inspires bad habits in young Athenians (23c2-24b2)}

In addition to the people Socrates offends, he also has to worry about his
young imitators offending people.  Many wealthy young Athenians follow
Socrates around, and they the imitate his procedure themselves. This means
that they infuriate other people, and those people blame Socrates for
having given the youth these habits.  Because these angry people have
nothing real to say against Socrates, they lob generic ``evil philosopher"
complaints against him: investigating heavens and earth, religious novelty,
making weaker argument stronger.\footnote{Don't the angry people have the
genuine complaint against Socrates that he corrupted the youth in the way
he describes? Why does he not consider that a real complaint?}

% {{{ Does Socrates harm the youth? (24c3--26b2)
\subsection{Does Socrates harm the youth? (24c3--26b2)}

Socrates says that Meletus ~--- not Socrates --- harms the youth by
claiming to care about them when he does not. Socrates engages in a brief
elenchus with Meletus.  Since Meletus has brought Socrates to trial for
corrupting the youth, Socrates infers that Meletus must care a great deal
about who harms and who benefits young people. But Socrates is able to show
rather quickly that Meletus has not put very much thought into these
questions.  Meletus ends up saying that the laws of Athens and
\emph{everyone} except Socrates benefits young people and that Socrates
alone harms them.  Socrates then employs a version of his characteristic
τεχνή argument: In the case of horses and other animals, many people may
harm them and only a small group of experts benefit them. Therefore, by
analogy, isn't it odd to think that \emph{everyone} in Athens except
Socrates benefits the youth?  Although this argument is rapid and sketchy,
the passage as a whole does imply that Meletus hasn't given the matter much
thought at all.

Next Socrates forces a dilemma on Meletus. Either he corrupted the youth
involuntarily and so deserves advice not punishment, or he deliberately
acted in a way likely to harm himself which nobody does.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is better to live among good citizens than bad ones because
        good fellow citizens benefit you while bad fellow citizens harm
        you (25c5--10).
    \item No one wishes to be harmed by their fellow citizens rather than
        being benefited by them (25d1--5). (At the end, this becomes simply
        ``Is there anyone who wishes to be harmed?" Strictly speaking,
        Meletus denies only the more limited version, though Socrates may
        be relying on the stronger version in what follows.)
    \item It is not believable that Socrates wouldn't know that if he makes
        his fellow citizens base, they are likely to do him some evil
        (25d9--25e5).
    \item Therefore, Socrates concludes that either (1) he didn't corrupt
        the youths or (2) he did so unwillingly (25e6--26a1).
\end{enumerate}

In one sense, this argument seems characteristically Socratic.  Socrates
frequently understands \phrase{harming someone} as making them morally
worse.  So it makes sense for him to interpret, corrupting (διαφθείρειν)
the youth as a matter of making them worse people.  Nevertheless, that
makes the argument awful, since we have no particular reason to believe
that corrupted youth harm \emph{all} their fellow citizens
indiscriminately.  It's easy to imagine, for example, that the young men
that Socrates corrupts wouldn't harm \emph{him} because they hold him in
such high esteem.

An additional problem with this argument is that it seems to prove too
much.  If we accept it, then isn't the same line of defense open to
everyone?  If so, then apparently nobody commits this particular crime in
a way that merits punishment.  If anything, then, the argument is not so
much a specific defense of Socrates as a reason to change the law.
Socrates, however, does not choose to explicitly present the argument in
that light.
% }}} Does Socrates harm the youth? (24c3--26b2)

% {{{ Does Socrates commit religious crimes? (26b2--28a1)
\subsection{Does Socrates commit religious crimes? (26b2--28a1)}

Next Socrates considers the accusation that he commits religious crimes.
He begins by noting that according to Meletus irreligion is the specific
means by which Socrates corrupts the youth.  So the two charges are very
closely connected (26b2--6).

The argument quickly becomes odd. Socrates hones in only on part of the
irreligion charge: that he doesn't believe in the gods of Athens.
Socrates, however, feigns (?) confusion and asks Meletus whether the charge
is atheism (full stop) or merely not believing in the gods of
Athens.\footnote{I say \word{feigns} because the charge itself seems
entirely clear everywhere else.  Meletus formally charged Socrates with
not believing in the city's gods.  I'm unsure where Socrates came up with
the idea of asking about atheism, and I don't see why Meletus takes the
bait.  Either Plato is very unfair to Meletus at this point, or something
about the charge has been lost in transmission.}  Meletus goes for atheism,
and at that point Socrates has him.

Socrates quickly shows that Meletus contradicted himself.  On the one hand,
Meletus has just said that Socrates is an atheist. On the other hand, in
his original indictment, Meletus also accused Socrates of believing in
``other new gods" (24c1).  Socrates argues as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nobody believes in things-related-to-X and yet doesn't believe in
        X.  As examples, Socrates asks whether anyone believes in ``human
        things" but not humans or ``equine things" but not horses.
        Socrates also gets Meletus to concede that no one believes in
        δαιμόνια but not δαίμονας (27b13--27c3).
    \item Meletus has already stated that Socrates introduces new
        divinities (27c5--8).
    \item Therefore, by Meletus' own argument Socrates must believe in some
        divine beings, namely δαίμονες (27c8--10).
    \item Therefore, since δαίμονες are gods, then Socrates cannot be
        a complete atheist, and so what Meletus just said contradicts his
        earlier charges (27c10--d10).

% {{{ Socrates defends the life of philosophy (28b3--30d6)
\section{Socrates defends the life of philosophy (28b3--30d6)}

Socrates has wrapped up his formal defense (see 28a2--28b2), and he shifts
gears to a more general defense of his odd lifestyle and choices.

First he imagines someone who asks, ``Aren't you ashamed to live a life
that might get you killed?" (28b3--5).  In response Socrates argues that it
shows poor judgement to worry about life or death. Instead, he claims that
the only thing a person should consider when acting is whether or not he
does just things (28b6--c1).  Socrates also makes an analogy to the
soldiers in Homer's \book{Iliad} who acted without consideration for death
(28c1--d4).

This leads Socrates to compare his philosophical mission to his actions as
a soldier.  When he was ordered to stand his ground in battle, he did so.
In the same way, the god has now ordered Socrates to philosophize, to
investigate himself and others.  It would be impious for him to betray
these orders (28d5--29a5).\footnote{Socrates even jokes that if he did so,
then it would be appropriate to bring him to trial for impiety (29a2--5).}

Socrates argues that disobeying the orders of the god because he feared
death would amount to thinking he was wise when he was not (29a4--5).
Specifically, fearing death is thinking one is wise when one is not
(29a5--29b2).  Nobody, says Socrates, knows whether death is a benefit or
a harm, but people fear it as if they knew.

Following this line of thought, Socrates makes one of his strongest claims
to knowledge anywhere in the early dialogues:

\begin{quote}
    τὸ δὲ ἀδικεῖν καὶ ἀπειθεῖν τῷ βελτίονι καὶ θεῷ καὶ ἀνθρώπῳ, ὅτι κακὸν
    καὶ αἰσχρόν ἐστιν οἶδα (29b6--7).

    But to commit an injustice and to disobey one's better, whether divine
    or human, I know that is evil and shameful.
\end{quote}

We might argue that Socrates claims knowledge here only because these
ethical claims are almost true by definition.  Nevertheless, it is worth
noting the claim.
